✋ Hand Detector Module

The Hand Detector Module is a Python-based computer vision project designed to detect and track human hands in real-time using a webcam feed.
Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe, this module provides the foundation for gesture-based applications such as virtual mice, sign recognition, and touchless control systems.

It demonstrates how AI-driven vision models can interpret hand landmarks and movements to enable intuitive, interactive experiences.
